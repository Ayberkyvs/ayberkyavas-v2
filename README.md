## Project Name & Pitch

ayberkyavas.com portfolio website 

A portfolio website is a digital platform that showcases the professional endeavors, projects, and career progression of an individual or a company. It serves as a dynamic repository reflecting oneâ€™s skills, achievements, and experiences in their field of expertise. I have decided to create my portfolio website to present the projects I have worked on and to chart my development journey. I continually update the site with every new piece of knowledge I acquire in the realm of web development, ensuring it remains a current and comprehensive reflection of my professional capabilities. Visitors to the site can gain insights into both my personal and project-related endeavors, built with Vite, React, Router, TypeScript, TailwindCSS, MirageJS, JavaScript, and CSS.

## Project Status

The project is completed, open to development and new features may come.
